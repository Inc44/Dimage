Downloads all media assets from JSON files generated by [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Parses `.json` export files from DiscordChatExporter.
- Downloads guild icons, user avatars, mention avatars, reaction avatars, custom emojis (inline and in reactions), and message attachments.
- Organizes downloaded media into subdirectories named after the source channel or DM.
- Optionally categorizes media into folders (`icons`, `avatars`, `emojis`, `channels`) using a command-line flag.
- Sets local file modification timestamps to match the original Discord message timestamps.
- Skips duplicate URLs to avoid redundant downloads and improve performance.
- Offers fine-grained control over which asset types to download via command-line flags.
- Supports skipping downloads based on file extensions.
- Includes a mode to set timestamps on existing files without downloading.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers

- **Default File Extension**: If a file extension cannot be determined from the URL, the tool defaults to `.png` for icons, avatars, and standard emojis. Animated emojis default to `.gif`.
- **Timestamp-Only Mode**: The `--timestamp-only` mode assumes the file structure and naming have not been altered since the initial download. It relies on a processing order that may be unstable if files have been moved, renamed, or deleted. Use this feature only to refresh timestamps on an unmodified collection of downloaded files.
- **Testing**: This software is tested manually. Automated testing of download functionality is not feasible because Discord media links expire after 24 hours.

## üöÄ Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install dimage
```

### With pipx

```bash
pipx install dimage
```

### With Conda

```bash
conda create -n dimage python=3.9 -y
conda activate dimage
pip install dimage
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Inc44/Dimage.git
cd Dimage
```

To install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

To install only the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_If you install only the dependencies, run the program using_ `python -m dimage.cli` _(or_ `python -OO dimage/cli.py`_) instead of the_ `dimage` _command._

## üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source

```bash
pip install build
python -m build
```

## üì¶ Publish

```bash
pip install twine
twine upload dist/*
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Standard Download
Download all media, skipping duplicates and SVG files. Media will be organized into folders named after each channel. Assumes your JSON files are in a directory named `json`.
```bash
dimage --no-dupes --skip svg
```

### Organized Download

Download all media, skipping duplicates and SVG files. Media will be organized by type (`icons`, `avatars`, `emojis`, `channels`).

```bash
dimage --no-dupes --skip svg --organize
```

### Update Timestamps Only

Apply original timestamps to already downloaded files. Assumes files are in an organized structure. No new files will be downloaded. Displays info and warnings.

```bash
dimage --no-dupes --skip svg --timestamp-only --organize --loglevel info
```

### Attachments Only

Download only message attachments, skipping all other media types, duplicates, and SVG files.

```bash
dimage --no-guild-icon --no-avatars --no-mentions --no-reactions --no-reactions-emojis --no-inline-emojis --no-dupes --skip svg
```

_I prefer to skip SVG files, as in 99.99% of cases, they are just standard Discord emojis._

## üéØ Motivation

[DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) supports only message exporting. Discord media links expire after 24 hours, making media preservation with exported JSON impossible. So, in February 2025, I decided to create the original version of this tool to download all media assets from exported JSON files before links expire, enabling message importing with [Dimport](https://github.com/Inc44/Dimport).

## ‚õî Known Limitations

Not yet known.

## üöß TODO

- [ ] **Refactor for Concurrency**: Re-architect the download logic using `asyncio` and `aiohttp` to replace the current sequential, blocking `requests` implementation. This will significantly improve performance.
- [ ] **Implement Persistent Cache**: Replace the in-memory `visited_urls` set with a persistent on-disk cache (e.g., a simple database or a state file). This will allow the application to be stopped and resumed, prevent redundant downloads, and enable recovery from interruptions.
- [ ] **Add Robust Retry Logic**: Integrate a library such as `tenacity` or `retrying` into the download function to automatically handle transient network errors, timeouts, and HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) status codes with exponential backoff.
- [ ] **Establish Formal Testing**: Develop a formal test suite using `pytest`. Implement mocking for network requests to test application logic without relying on expiring Discord URLs. Add `coverage` to measure test effectiveness and identify untested code paths.
