# Dimage

[![Build](https://github.com/Inc44/Dimage/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Inc44/Dimage/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Downloads all media assets from JSON files generated by [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Parses `.json` export files from DiscordChatExporter.
- Downloads guild icons, user avatars, mention avatars, reaction avatars, custom emojis (inline and in reactions), and message attachments.
- Organizes downloaded media into subdirectories named after the source channel or DM.
- Optionally categorizes media into folders (`icons`, `avatars`, `emojis`, `channels`) using a command-line flag.
- Sets local file modification timestamps to match the original Discord message timestamps.
- Skips duplicate URLs to avoid redundant downloads and improve performance.
- Offers fine-grained control over which asset types to download via command-line flags.
- Supports skipping downloads based on file extensions.
- Includes a mode to set timestamps on existing files without downloading.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers

- **Default File Extension**: If a file extension cannot be determined from the URL, the tool defaults to `.png` for icons, avatars, and standard emojis. Animated emojis default to `.gif`.
- **Timestamp-Only Mode**: The `--timestamp-only` mode assumes the file structure and naming have not been altered since the initial download. It relies on a processing order that may be unstable if files have been moved, renamed, or deleted. Use this feature only to refresh timestamps on an unmodified collection of downloaded files.

## üöÄ Installation

### From PyPI
```bash
pip install dimage
```

### With pipx

## üõ†Ô∏è Build
```bash
pip install build
python -m build
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Standard Download
Download all media, skipping duplicates and SVG files. Media will be organized into folders named after each channel. Assumes your JSON files are in a directory named `json`.
```bash
dimage --no-dupes --skip svg
```

### Organized Download
Download all media, skipping duplicates and SVG files. Media will be organized by type (`icons`, `avatars`, `emojis`, `channels`).
```bash
dimage --no-dupes --skip svg --organize
```

### Update Timestamps Only
Apply original timestamps to already downloaded files. Assumes files are in an organized structure. No new files will be downloaded.
```bash
dimage --no-dupes --skip svg --timestamp-only --organize
```

### Attachments Only
Download only message attachments, skipping all other media types, duplicates, and SVG files.
```bash
dimage --no-guild-icon --no-avatars --no-mentions --no-reactions --no-reactions-emojis --no-inline-emojis --no-dupes --skip svg
```
_I prefer to skip SVG files, as in 99.99% of cases, they are just Discord's standard emojis._
